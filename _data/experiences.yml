  • Using open source AutoML technology and working with engine experts, created a blade failure algorithm
  to correctly predict failures in this critical engine component. Involved typical Data Science steps of data
  exploration, feature engineering (to include creating synthetic records), model selection, evaluation
  and user acceptance.
  <br><br>
  • Using Docker, established the correct dependencies and containerization procedures to allow a critical
  engine health algorithm to deploy in any technical environment. This is expected to be utilized across several
  rotorcraft platforms, become a key component of predicting engine health, and improve predictability at many downstream supply
  chain and maintenance organizations.
