  <br><br>
  • Developed and productionized two market data based XGBoost price prediction algorithms to significantly increase
  sales and average policy premium. Effort involved all typical aspects of data science model development including data sourcing through model selection & hyperparameter tuning.
  <br><br>
  • Directed a small team in developing and operationalizing an MLOps platform on Databricks.
  This solution enhances agility by enabling a balance between model complexity and response time which is crucial for accommodating the quick response time cutoffs imposed by aggregator sites.
  <br><br>
  • Created model interpretability modules using SHAP values for increasing trust in an NLP based claims prediction algorithm."

  to reform readiness understanding within the organization. 
  <br><br>
  • Using open source AutoML technology and working with engine experts, created a blade failure algorithm
  to correctly predict failures in this critical engine component. Involved typical Data Science steps of data
  exploration, feature engineering (to include creating synthetic records), model selection, evaluation
  and user acceptance.
  <br><br>
  • Using Docker, established the correct dependencies and containerization procedures to allow a critical
  engine health algorithm to deploy in any technical environment. This is expected to be utilized across several
  rotorcraft platforms, become a key component of predicting engine health, and improve predictability at many downstream supply
  chain and maintenance organizations."
