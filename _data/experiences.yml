  gains by automatically processing millions of records from hundreds of files into various reporting mechanisms.
  *In preparation for the 2020 census, led a statistical analysis which resulted in a linear regression model that
  combined several demographic factors into a predictive model for consumer response rates at the ZIP code level
  for 39,000+ distinct ZIP codes.
  *Successfully positioned our team to win future work by designing and socializing an executive dashboard that
  visualizes system performance, user interaction and response rates across the United States.
