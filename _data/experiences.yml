- experience:
  role: Federal Technology Analyst, IT Cost Estimation Lead
  time: 7/2015 - 5/2017
  company: Deloitte Consulting LLP, Washington D.C.
  details: "Through effective client management of 35+ continuing stakeholders and various IT project teams, led the IT investment
  management process for major IT investments over $5 million dollars. This validation on close to a billion dollars across 31
  separate IT projects in fiscal year 2017 alone, ensured accurate & rigorous estimates were given as a foundation to these
  projects funding needs. This high visibility role required a high degree of professionalism as these projects are often mission
  critical to the business customers they serve, their approval is pivotal to the project owners careers, and multiple tollgates
  are in place that require frequent VP level discussions. In addition I led the effort to predict IT spend at the VP of IT level
  using advanced time series forecasting methods. This analysis on an approximately billion dollar budget, when measured against
  fiscal year performance, had an average error of only 7%."
